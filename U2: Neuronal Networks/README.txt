In this module I created a Neuronal Network that tries to predict images based on the pixels and our dataset.
Our training and testing data was withdrawn from the Keras datasets.
I made the decision to train it with 10 epochs, because it was the most optimal accuracy percentage I got after trying with other values.
I learnt how overfitting works and why it can be misleading.
I also made a mini function to visualize better the prediction by showing the img expected and predicted in an interface.
